<h1>Delayed Auditory Feedback & Altered Auditory Feedback app</h1>

This app uses the [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) library to process audio taken from the default system input, applies a delay & change in pitch, then plays it back to the user using the default system output.

The result is a simulated choral speaking effect. In other words, it sounds like there is someone speaking the same words along with you. This effect can be used to increase fluency for people who stutter.
